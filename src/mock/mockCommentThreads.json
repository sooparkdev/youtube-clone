For instance my  friend who has a debit card his bank account has stayed at around about $600-$700 since a month in he started working a couple months previous before I started working at the same place. Every two weeks our paycheck equals out to about $280-$350 he has worked there for about 8-9months, in contrast Iâ€™ve worked for 6 months I have about $3000 in my bank account. Everyday during school he will purchase normally about 3 items from the vending machines which costs $1.50 x 3 which is about $5 per day 5 days a week. So in two weeks thatâ€™s $50 gone and thatâ€™s not even including the money spent on dinner with friends or stuff for hobbies. Itâ€™s incredible what having money instantly at a certain time can do and being unable to see how much your spending at a given moment. I didnâ€™t  mean for this to ramble but it ended up doing so.",
