/* The code you provided shows that you're using a React Router (specifically a newer Concurrent React API with the `createRoot` method, 
which is designed for concurrent rendering). Here's a breakdown:

1. You create a `router` using `createBrowserRouter`, defining your routes:
   - The root route (`/`) renders the `<App />` component.
   - A child route (`/`) that matches the base index renders the `<DefaultPage />` component.
   - A child route (`/results`) renders the `<SearchPage />` component.
   - A child route (`/watch`) renders the `<VideoDetailsPage />` component.

2. You're creating a root using `ReactDOM.createRoot` which points to a DOM element with the id `'root'`. This is your entry point for React to render components into the DOM.

3. Within the `root.render` method, you're rendering the `RouterProvider` component and passing the `router` (that you've configured with your routes) as a prop to `RouterProvider`.

The missing piece here is how the `RouterProvider` uses the passed `router`. Based on conventional patterns:

- `RouterProvider` would use the `router` prop to set up the actual routing logic.
- Depending on the URL path, `RouterProvider` will render the appropriate component (`<App />`, `<DefaultPage />`, `<SearchPage />`, or `<VideoDetailsPage />`).

In other words, when you navigate to different paths in your application, the `RouterProvider` will consult the `router` configuration to decide which component to render. 

For your original concern about how the components are rendered: 
Every time you visit a specific path in your application, the corresponding component mentioned in your `router` configuration is rendered because of the way the `RouterProvider` and the `router` prop work together. So, even if you don't see a direct rendering structure like `<RouterProvider><App /></RouterProvider>` in your `index.js`, the routing configuration ensures the right component gets rendered for the right path. */
